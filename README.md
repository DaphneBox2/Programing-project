## Background of the project
The last couple of years the idea of a basic income is regaining public interest and the discussion about the concept of an unconditional income to all citizens of a country resurgence.
Due to the increased interest, it is worthwhile to investigate the brought opinion about the basic income and if there is a relation between opinion about basic income and demographics in different European countries.

## Problem statement
Because at present there are no visualizations available about the public opinion of basic income, it is hard to really pin-point the actual opinion about the basic income and its division over the population per European country. The main target audience of this project will be people with interest in the basic income. 

## Solution of the problem
The solution to this problem is to create a website that shows a map of Europe where the countries are coloured according to a specific opinion about an aspect of the basic income and when clicked on the country the division of that opinion over the population is shown in total and split up according to different demographics.

## Datasets
The data set that is used to build this website comes from kaggle.com.
Furthermore, I will likely need to use the following libraries: d3, d3-tip, d3-queue, topojson/datamaps.
